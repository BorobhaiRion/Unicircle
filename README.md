# 🎓 UniCircle Kickstart Dashboard

The **UniCircle Kickstart Dashboard** is a centralized platform built for university students to manage non-academic needs such as buying & selling items, finding shared housing, and connecting with tutors or learners.  
It provides a **secure, student-only environment** where verified users can collaborate, communicate, and support each other, reducing everyday hassle while fostering a strong student community.
